# Asyncrush

**High Performance Middleware Streams** üèéÔ∏è

Asyncrush is a **high-performance stream processing library** that leverages the **middleware pattern** inspired by RxJS. Unlike traditional stream libraries, Asyncrush connects middleware using pure functions instead of operators, offering a **flexible, efficient, and scalable** approach to stream processing. It dramatically improves performance while minimizing memory usage, making it the ideal choice for high-throughput applications.

<br>

## ‚ö° Key Features
- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Achieves up to 2x faster performance compared to traditional stream libraries.
- **Middleware-based Stream Control**: Process streams with middleware instead of operators, allowing for dynamic error handling, custom retry policies, and advanced state management.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimized object creation and small code size lead to significant reductions in memory consumption.
- **Developer-Friendly API**: The pure function-based API ensures that the library is easy to understand, use, and maintain.
- **Built-in Error Handling & Backoff**: Automatic error handling and backoff strategies allow for stable and resilient stream processing, even in the face of network or data failures.

## üíæ Installation
```bash
npm install asyncrush
```

<br>

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage Example
```typescript
const stream = new RushStream<number>((observer) => {
  observer.next(1);
});

stream.use(
  (v: number) => v + 1,
  (v: number) => v * 2
).listen({
  next: (value) => {
    console.log(value);
  },
  complete: () => { },
});
```
